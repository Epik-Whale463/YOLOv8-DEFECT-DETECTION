## üìã Project Overview

This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting and classifying defects on metallic surfaces using YOLOv8. The model is trained to identify six types of common defects:

- Crazing
- Inclusion
- Patches
- Pitted Surface
- Rolled-in Scale
- Scratches

This solution can be integrated into manufacturing quality control systems to automate defect detection, improving efficiency and reducing errors in quality inspection processes.

## üîç Dataset

The project uses the Metallic Surface Defect dataset, which contains images of various defects commonly found in metallic surfaces during manufacturing. The dataset includes:

- 555 annotated defect instances across 295 validation images
- 6 defect classes with varying frequencies
- Annotations in YOLO format

## üß† Model Architecture

- Base model: YOLOv8n (nano version)
- Input size: 640√ó640
- Training strategy: Transfer learning from pre-trained weights

## üîß Training Details

The model was trained on Kaggle using a Tesla P100 GPU with the following configuration:

- **Epochs**: 50
- **Batch Size**: 16
- **Optimizer**: Default YOLOv8 optimizer
- **Augmentations**: 
  - Mosaic (auto-disabled in last epochs)
  - Blur and MedianBlur (p=0.01)
  - ToGray (p=0.01)
  - CLAHE (p=0.01)
